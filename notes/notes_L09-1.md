======================

- Motivations behind development of NoSQL
    - cost
        - open source software
        - runs on the cloud
            - scales with you
            - pay for what you use
    - flexibility
        - unstructured data collection
        - received before understood
            - vs prescribing exact shape of data (relational)
    - availability
        - distributed topology allows for easily adding nodes

- Monitoring Databases
    - tool-set
        - SQl Server Profiler
            - minutia
            - view code and commands as executed
            - allows viewing and capturing all transactional activity
            - trace
                - subsystem like a net to find issues
                    - can run trace on filtered set of data
                        - user, server, stored prcedure
                - have a plan
                -start with templates
                - execution
                    - avoid client-side
                        - data must be transfered
                        - lot of overhead
                    - server side
                        - store locally on server, view later
                        - doesn't stress network
                - saving trace
                    - file
                    - table
        - System monitor (perfMon)
            - OS monitor
        - Activity monitor
            - who is connected, what is going on
        - Task manager
            - OS level overview
        - Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)
            - Understand current state of db
            - presented as system views
            - categories
                - `dm_db_*` 
                    - statistics
    - measurements
        - must know db env
            - transactions, data flow, customers, hardware, db objects, skills of staff
        - know baseline for when things go wrong
    - why
        - be proactive
            - adress concerns before it becomes problem
    - what senarios shoulb be monitores
        - look when there is performance issue to fix
        - look when no issue to get benchmark
    - how to monitor
        - use tools
