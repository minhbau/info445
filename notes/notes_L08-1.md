======================

- db mirroring log shipping and replication 
    - mirroring
        - high availability solution
            - synchronous data transfer between two nodes
            - done via two-phase commit
            - done when service availability more important than accuracy
                - ex: more important for store to be open
        - no correlation between uptime and data loss
    - replication
        - high scalability solution
        - data filtered based on relevancy
            - function or region
            - vertical and horizontal partitioning
        - operations run faster
            - less data to iterate over
    - log shipping
        - read only
        - used for internal reporting
        - full copy of db

- resume
    - did live troubleshooting of a db containing 1,000,000 rows and restore to point in time
    - replication and log shipping

- RAID
    - Redundant array of independent disks
    - configuration not part of SQL server, part of hardware configuration
    - enables fault tolerance
    - types
        - RAID 0
            - disk striping
                - block of data is broken into chunks and written in parallel to multiple disks
                - great performance
                    - read and write in parallel
                - bad fault tolerance
                    - lose one disk and all data is unusable
                - great disk cost-efficiency
        - RAID 1
            - disk mirroring
                - same data signal is written to both disk channels
                    - no communication between disk channels
                - good performance
                    - able to read in parallel
                - better fault tolerance
                - fair disk cost-efficency (N/2)
        - RAID 5
            - disk striping + parity
                - parity
                    - part of disk that contains info on what happened elsewhere
                    - if lose a drive, can combine parity to get data back
                    - only able to lose one drive
                - fair performance
                    - bad because you have to write twice
                - fair fault tolerance
                - good disk cost-efficiency (N-1)
                - only used for when disk was expensive
        - RAID 1+0
            - mirroring + striping
                - great performance
                - great fault-tolerance
                - fair disk cost-efficiency

- Database Maintenance
    - must know env to do maintenance
        - transactions
            - inserts updates deletes
            - how / how often data comes into system
            - what objects are affected
        - data flow
            - how data moves once in a db
            - life cycle of data (how is data changed)
        - customers (internal and external)
            - must know data needs and priorities
        - hardware
            - RAID, disk capacity, cpus
            - know where single points of failure are
            - how powerful / capabilities of each system
            - useful life cycle
        - db objects
            - stored procedures, logins, jobs, tables
            - which objects are most important to customers
            - which objects have highest activity
        - skills of dba staff
            - understand what people do well to work better as a team
            - SWOT analysis
            - opportunities to strengthen team
                - person with most experience might not be right person for task
    - system vulnerabilities
        - want to do proactive maintenance
            - daily tasks
                - backups of data, checking error logs
                - writing hand-off reports
    - goals
        - build routine set of tasks that improve value of bd environment
        - maintenance must be defined
        - optimized over time
        - measurable
