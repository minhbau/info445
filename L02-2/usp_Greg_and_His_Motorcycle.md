`usp_Greg_and_His_Motorcycle`
=============================

Once upon a time, the mystical and ancient wizard Greg was sent on a quest to save the kingdom of ischool from the dreaded evils of the database locking monster. Knowing what must be done, Greg got on his trusted motorcycle and rode with an army one hundo strong to stop the menace. When they reached the cave of the dreaded monster, Greg donned his dog costume, pointed his magic staff at the monster with only one hand, and uttered the magic words "today is a good day". In a flash of bright light, the database monster became so efficient it ceased to exist in this plane of existence, and was no more. Turning back to his army as he returned to his motorcycle, Greg told his hundo strong army that what they saw may have looked impressive, but it really wasn't, but that being able to do it in a wizard interview would guarantee them a job. With that, Greg, still in his dog costume, rode off off into the sunset with his trusted motorcycle which didn't have any flat tires, to save the day again.
